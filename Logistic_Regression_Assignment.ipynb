        "Output: Predicts the probability of a class label (e.g., 0 or 1).\n",

        "\n",
        "🔹 1. Linear Combination of Inputs\n",
        "Just like linear regression, logistic regression starts by computing a linear combination of the input features:\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 2. Sigmoid (Logistic) Function\n",

        "Q3.  Why do we use the Sigmoid function in Logistic Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans3. We use the sigmoid function in logistic regression because it converts any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1, making it ideal for probability estimation in classification problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Main Reasons for Using Sigmoid\n",
        "1. Probability Output\tThe sigmoid squashes the linear output to a [0, 1] range, allowing interpretation as a probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Binary Classification\tIn logistic regression, we model the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., success/failure, 0/1).\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans5. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function of logistic regression. This penalty discourages the model from fitting the training data too closely by shrinking the coefficients (weights) toward zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why is Regularization Needed?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
