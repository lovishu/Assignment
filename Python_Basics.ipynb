        "Q1:Explain the key features of Python that makes it popular choice for programming?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans1:Python is widely popular for several reasons, and its key features make it a top choice for programming:\n",
        "\n",
        "a: Readability and Simplicity: Python has a clean and easy-to-read syntax, making it beginner-friendly. Its structure mimics plain English, which reduces the learning curve and improves code readability.\n",
        "b:Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language, meaning code is executed line by line, which simplifies debugging and allows for interactive testing.\n",
        "c:Extensive Standard Library: Python has a vast collection of libraries and modules for various tasks like file handling, web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. This reduces the need to write code from scratch.\n",
        "d:Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python is cross-platform, meaning it can run on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modification.\n",
        "e:Dynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed, so you donâ€™t need to declare the data type of a variable. This increases flexibility and simplifies the code.\n",
        "f:Object-Oriented and Functional Programming: Python supports both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, allowing developers to choose the style that best suits their needs.\n",
        "g:Strong Support for Data Science and AI: Python's popularity has surged in fields like data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence due to libraries like NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn.\n",

        "Q2: Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a  program?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS2: In Python, predefined keywords (also known as reserved words) are part of the language's syntax and have specific meanings. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names, function names, or any other names) because they are reserved for defining the structure and control flow of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Role of Predefined Keywords:\n",
        "1:Control the Flow of a Program: Keywords such as if, else, while, and for are used to create conditional statements and loops.\n",
        "2:Define Functions, Classes, and Variables: Keywords like def, class, and global help in defining functions, classes, and controlling the scope of variables.\n",
        "3:Handle Exceptions: Keywords like try, except, and finally are used for exception handling.\n",
        "4:Work with Data Structures: Keywords like True, False, None represent Boolean values and null values, respectively.\n",
        "5:Memory Management: Keywords such as del are used to free up memory by removing references to objects.\n",
        "Examples of Predefined Keywords in Use:\n",
        "1: Conditional Statements:\n",
        "Here, the if and else keywords are used to make a decision based on the value of x.\n",
        "2:Looping with for:The for keyword is used to iterate over the sequence generated by range(3).\n",
        "3:Function Definition with def:\n",
        "The def keyword defines the function greet, which returns a greeting message.\n",
        "4:Handling Exceptions:\n",
        "The try, except, and finally keywords manage exceptions and ensure the program handles errors gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3:Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Pythojn with examples?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS3:In Python, objects are classified as either mutable or immutable based on whether their state (or content) can be changed after they are created. This distinction impacts how objects behave when they are modified.\n",
