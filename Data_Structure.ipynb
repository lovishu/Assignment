        "\n",
        "1. Accessing Elements\n",
        "You can access list elements using indexing and slicing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Indexing: Use the index number to access a specific element. Indexing starts at 0.Negative Indexing: Negative indices can be used to access elements from the end of the list.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans4: In Python, both tuples and lists are used to store collections of items, but they have key differences in terms of mutability, syntax, and performance. Here's a detailed comparison:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Mutability\n",
        "Lists: Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify them after creation. You can add, remove, or update elements in a list.\n",
        "Tuples: Tuples are immutable, meaning once a tuple is created, you cannot modify, add, or remove elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "2: Syntax\n",
        "Lists: Lists are defined using square brackets [].\n",
        "Tuples: Tuples are defined using parentheses (). A tuple with a single element requires a comma to differentiate it from a regular expression inside parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "3: Performance\n",
        "Lists: Lists are slower compared to tuples in certain operations because they are mutable. The flexibility of allowing element modifications and dynamic resizing adds overhead.\n",
        "Tuples: Tuples are generally faster than lists because they are immutable. Python can optimize tuples better since their size and content don’t change.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Use Cases\n",
        "Lists: Use lists when you need a collection of items that may need to be modified, sorted, or resized during the program's lifecycle.\n",
        "Tuples: Use tuples when you want a collection of items that should remain constant throughout the program, like fixed data or configuration settings.\n",

        "Q5: Describe the key features on sets and provide examples of their use in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS5: Key Features of Sets in Python\n",
        "1: Unordered Collection:\n",
        "Sets are unordered, meaning the elements do not have a defined order. This also means that items cannot be accessed by an index.\n",
        "\n",
        "2: Unique Elements:\n",
        "A set cannot have duplicate elements. If duplicates are added, they are automatically removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3:Mutable:\n",
        "Sets are mutable, meaning that elements can be added or removed after the set is created, but the elements themselves must be immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).\n",
        "\n",
        "4:No Indexing or Slicing:\n",
        "Unlike lists or tuples, sets do not support indexing or slicing.\n",

        "ANS6: Use Cases of Tuples and Sets in Python\n",
        "Both tuples and sets serve different purposes in Python due to their distinct characteristics. Here's a detailed breakdown of the use cases for each:\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples\n",
        "1. Fixed Data Structures\n",
        "Tuples are immutable, which makes them ideal for storing fixed collections of items that shouldn’t change throughout the program.\n",
        "Use Case: Storing coordinates or RGB color values that must remain constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Function Return Values\n",
        "Functions can return multiple values as a tuple, making it easy to return a collection of related data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Dictionary Keys\n",
        "Tuples can be used as keys in a dictionary because they are immutable, unlike lists.\n",
        "Use Case: Storing multi-dimensional or composite data as dictionary keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Packing and Unpacking\n",
        "Tuples support packing multiple values into a single tuple and unpacking them into separate variables, which can enhance code readability.\n",
        "Use Case: Assigning multiple variables at once or swapping values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sets\n",
        "1. Removing Duplicates\n",
        "\n",
        "Sets automatically remove duplicate values, making them useful when you need unique items from a collection.\n",
        "Use Case: Filtering a list to get only unique elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Fast Membership Testing\n",
        "Sets provide a very fast way to check if an element exists in the collection because they are implemented using hash tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Case: Checking if an item exists in a large dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Set Operations (Union, Intersection, Difference)\n",
        "\n",
        "Sets are designed for performing mathematical set operations such as union, intersection, and difference, which makes them ideal for comparing collections.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Case: Finding common or distinct elements between two groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7: Describe how to add, modify and delete items on a dictonary with examples?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS7: In Python, a dictionary is a mutable data structure that allows you to store data in key-value pairs. You can easily add, modify, and delete items in a dictionary. Here’s how:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Adding Items to a Dictionary\n",
        "To add a new key-value pair to a dictionary, simply assign a value to a new key. If the key already exists, its value will be updated.\n",
        "\n",
        "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
        "\n",
        "# Adding a new key-value pair\n",

        "# Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
        "print(my_dict)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Modifying Items in a Dictionary\n",
        "You can modify the value associated with a particular key by reassigning it. If the key exists, it will update the value; if it doesn’t exist, a new key-value pair is added.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Deleting Items from a Dictionary\n",
        "You can delete items from a dictionary using several methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "A. Using del:\n",
        "Deletes the key-value pair from the dictionary.\n",
        "Raises a KeyError if the key is not found.\n",
        "\n",
        "B. Using pop():\n",
        "Removes the key and returns the corresponding value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Raises a KeyError if the key is not found, but you can provide a default return value to avoid this.\n",
        "\n",
        "C. Using popitem():\n",
        "Removes and returns the last key-value pair added to the dictionary.\n",
        "Raises a KeyError if the dictionary is empty.\n",
        "\n",

        "Q8: Discusses the importance of dictionary keys being immutable and provide exmaples?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS8: In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable because dictionaries use a technique called hashing to store and retrieve values efficiently. The key's immutability ensures that once it's used in a dictionary, its hash value won't change, maintaining the dictionary's integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why must dictionary keys be immutable?\n",
        "1: Hashing mechanism: Python dictionaries rely on a hash table internally. Each key is passed through a hash function to generate a hash value, which is used to place the key-value pair in the dictionary. For this to work consistently, the key’s hash value must remain constant. If keys could be mutable, modifying a key after it’s been hashed would disrupt the lookup process, as the new hash wouldn’t correspond to the original one.\n",
        "\n",
        "2: Data integrity: If dictionary keys were mutable, changing a key’s value would make it difficult to ensure that the dictionary functions correctly, leading to unpredictable behavior and possible data loss. The dictionary could lose track of the entry because the key is no longer found at its original hashed position.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of Immutable and Mutable Types\n",
