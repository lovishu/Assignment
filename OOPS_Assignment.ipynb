        "Ans1.The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class\n",
        "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Object\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with a unique identity, state (attributes), and behavior (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation\n",
        "Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components. This is typically achieved using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance\n",
        "Inheritance allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). It can be achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).\n",
